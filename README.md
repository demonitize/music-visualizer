# NOTICE

---

A **MAJOR** rewrite of this project is going to be happenning Soon™

What this means is that a lot of things are going to break. I'll try to limit the damage to the Unstable Build (oh yeah, there's an unstable build now! [You can test it here](https://music-visualizer.glitch.me/unstable)) but I cannot promise anything.

I will add a legacy version for people who like the old versions better.

## And now for some future updates coming Soon™

Main UI:

- New control scheme, with added controls and a duration viewer (idk what you call this but im too lazy to look it up)
- **CUSTOM RGB!!!!** Yes, I know it's kind of annoying that you are stuck with whatever I make the colors, but pretty Soon™ you'll be able to control the RGB! How cool is that!?
