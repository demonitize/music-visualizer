# That directory we don't talk about #

### You know, the one with the really bad code ###

---
Yeah, that's this directory right here!

---
Welcome to the folder where I put the code I really don't want people to look at.

It's not that this code contains API keys, passwords, or other personal information.
It's just that this code is really REALLY **REALLY** bad.

---
If you really want to see the code, you may proceed.

But remember,
