## Changes in Version 1.19.1:

- Made the loop button change depending on whether it's enabled or not.
- Changed the File Display System to reset to default when the audio finishes (unless it is looping, then it just is ignored)
- Found a bug where the brower won't even recognize when the audio is finished, making the above change useless (thanks JavaScript)
